            The Southern Colonies are Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and 
            Georgia. This region features broad rivers and vast wetlands that gradually merged 
            with the sea. The soil and the hot and wet cimate were ideal for farming. The king 
            appointed a governor, but otherwise the colonies were democratic. Because the colony is 
            populated by enlish people it is mostly christian (most of england was christian at the 
            time).

            The Middle Colonies are New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Deleware. They have rich 
            soil and wooded mountains, perfect for farming and lumbering. The government was 
            democratic along with a governer appointed by the king of England. The people who 
            settled the middle colonies represented many cultures and religions, so they are very 
            religously tolerant.

            The New England Colonies are New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Conneticut.
            The region has rocky hilly wilderness, theres also forests and sea. They made their 
            economy on lumbering, fishing, shipbuilding, and trade. These colonies were self 
            governed with a governer appointed by the king of England. The first settlers came to 
            avoid religous prosecution, Massachusetts organized a theocracy before a democracy.
